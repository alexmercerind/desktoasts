<h4 align="center">A Dart package to send native ðŸ’¬ toasts on Windows.</h4>


**Suggested Replacement: [win_toast](https://pub.dev/packages/win_toast)**

I have decided to discontinue this plugin.

I created this package in my very early days of learning C++, Flutter or creating plugins in general. Thus, it doesn't have good quality code that I would want people use in their production applications. Now that I have a lot of other popular packages to maintain & take care of, I don't have time to refactor code in this package since there is a [better alternative](https://pub.dev/packages/win_toast) available.

Older versions of the plugin are still available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/desktoasts).
